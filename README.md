# Project: CPU Docs Workspace

This workspace contains study/reference material related to CPU architecture.

Included file:

- `solix16&ISA.pdf` — a PDF document in the repository root. Open it with your preferred PDF viewer.

Quick tips:

- To open the PDF from the command line on Linux:

```bash
xdg-open "solix16&ISA.pdf"  # or use your preferred PDF viewer (evince, okular, mupdf, etc.)
```

- If you're using VS Code, you can open the file in the Explorer and preview it in the editor.

Notes:

- This repository currently contains only the PDF. If you want a more detailed README (project goals, build instructions, references, or contributor notes), tell me what to include and I'll expand it.
